OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications. Be sure to use client_credentials as grant type when connecting to this API.   <b>Simple step by step guide to receive required access token </b><br/><br/> 1) Get access token <br/><br/> http POST to https://oauth2test.signere.com/connect/token for test or https://oauth.signere.no/connect/token for prod <br/><br/> &bull; Request Headers: <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;Authorization: Basic auth with ClientId as username, and ClientSecret as password<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pseudo code: Authorization: "[ClientId]:[Secret]".ToBase64String() (utf-8) </i> <br/> <br> &bull; Request Body:<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;grant_type: client_credentials<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;scope: [insert scope(s) here] (Contact us if you dont have access to this scope) <br/> <br> 2) Use access token to access our API<br/><br/> In the response you will receive an item containing the id token you should use to connect to our API's named access_token.<br/> &bull; This token can then be added to the header in the requests to this API:<br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Authorization: Bearer [access_token] <br><br> We have created a guide to create Oauth2 tokens for different languages here: [https://sdk.signere.com/oauthtoken.html](https://sdk.signere.com/oauthtoken.html) <br><br><i>Hint: The access token has a limited lifetime, check how long it will live in the response. Then you can save it to cache and reuse it (our .NET nuget client does this for you)</i><br><br> Read more aboute OAuth2 here:  [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->  ",
